# CS50: Introduction to Computer Science
| Link | Description |
|----------|:-------------:|
| [cs50.harvard.edu](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/)|Introduction to the intellectual enterprises of computer science and the art of programming. This course teaches students how to think algorithmically and solve problems efficiently. Topics include abstraction, algorithms, data structures, encapsulation, resource management, security, and software engineering. Languages include C, Python, and SQL plus studentsâ€™ choice of: HTML, CSS, and JavaScript (for web development); Java or Swift (for mobile app development); or Lua (for game development). Problem sets inspired by the arts, humanities, social sciences, and sciences. Course culminates in a final project. Designed for concentrators and non-concentrators alike, with or without prior programming experience. Two thirds of CS50 students have never taken CS before. Among the overarching goals of this course are to inspire students to explore unfamiliar waters, without fear of failure, create an intensive, shared experience, accessible to all students, and build community among students.|

# Software Construction: Data Abstruction
| Link | Description |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| [software-construction-data-abstraction](https://www.edx.org/course/software-construction-data-abstraction) | This is the third course in the Software Development MicroMasters program. You will learn how to build larger and more complex software systems using the Java programming languageThe course begins with the topic of data abstraction - from specification to implementation. Particular attention is given to how to write robust tests using JUnit. Then the course expands on these ideas to explore how type hierarchies and polymorphism can be used to decrease redundancy in your code. The course wraps up with a discussion of how to design robust classes By the end of the course, you will have a solid foundation in designing software in Java, and be ready to move onto Software Construction: Object-Oriented Design, where you will learn more complex design patterns and principles designing object-oriented programs.Learners who enroll in the Verified track will receive staff grading for the course project and increased interaction with the instructors and staff.|

| [nand2tatris_part_i](https://www.nand2tetris.org/) | This site supports a course and a textbook that guide students and self-learners through the construction of a modern, full-scale computer system - hardware and software - from the ground up. In the process, the students practice many major computer science (CS) abstractions studied in typical CS courses and make them concrete through 12 guided implementation projects. The lectures, book chapters and projects are highly modular and one can pursue subsets of them in any desired order and scope. All the software tools and course materials can be downloaded freely and in open source from this site.|

# Data Science: Skills
| Link | Description |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| [dataCamp](https://www.datacamp.com/) | Data science is an interdisciplinary field focused on extracting knowledge from data sets, which are typically large (see big data).[6] The field encompasses analysis, preparing data for analysis, and presenting findings to inform high-level decisions in an organization. As such, it incorporates skills from computer science, mathematics, statistics, information visualization, graphic design, complex systems, communication and business.[7][8] Statistician Nathan Yau, drawing on Ben Fry, also links data science to human-computer interaction: users should be able to intuitively control and explore data.[9][10] In 2015, the American Statistical Association identified database management, statistics and machine learning, and distributed and parallel systems as the three emerging foundational professional communities.[11]|
